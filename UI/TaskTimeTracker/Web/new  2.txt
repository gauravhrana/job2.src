this logic looks totally wrong to me

u r direcitly using current index to set the UPCategory and load/set values accordingly
there can be cases where use would remove some control from middle then this could go wrong horribley

yeah
remove ke time pe
numofctrls dec ho raha hai
but UC entry remove nahi ho rahi

1 min

i have a suggestion

as u r storting "NoOfControls"
add 1 more "NameOfControls"

it would store all the UPcategorues seperatew by lets say "%%"

this way it would be easier to maintain.
wht do u think?
and store "NameOfControls" in UPK
yes

think on that
this way we will be able to find way to implement current task too i'm sure

i have to leaver right now
will talk later
ok 

this is my code changes
shall u run to show u error


1 more thing in load
this was assigning 1 to all 

as data wasnmt present it would assign 1 but once its implemented it would take care of itself


u should have made changes in the data then
if it assigns 1 to all then i think we need to correct before we move ahead
manually
for all branch controls

can u plz do it?
i will wait here

just assign 1 to 10 whatever the order

ok back end main
or if we user ctrl name here then it work fine

back end se
let me show u query

u have only 2 controls on the page?
no 3
then it should dhow here isnt it?
yeah..shayad ek bhaag gaya...try karte kerta

update for this 2 anyway

kep it 2 and 3 so if wo pehla sayad wapas aa jaye to uska by default 1 rahega :D
ok

go ahead and try then
ok
